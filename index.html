        <p>i am an student studing in grade 7. I am an active child who likes to play sport, watch thriller crime movies, sing english,tamil and hindi cover songs, read paranormal, mystery and crime books, play a piano, draw and code things. i have an badminton,football and basket ball court in my apartment, which i and my friends use while playing. I like english songs mostly sung by Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Camilla Cabello, Shawn Mendes, Selena Gomez and Charlie Puth. I also like the bands Imagine Dragons, Maroon 5, DJ Snake, chain smokers and Fifth Harmony. My favourite indian singer is Shreya Ghoshal, AR Rahaman, Vidya Vox and Sid Sriram. I am most picky about my book choice as i only like to read the books that compell me to keep on reading. I like Nancy Drew, Sherlock Homes Harry Potter and Percy Jackson.</p>
